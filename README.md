First Phase initiated.

Its time to write only the code for this small game. 

It will use Javascript, and eventually html and CSS so it can be a fully game of rock paper scissors.

After a long hiatus this project will continue in the next few days, first i would read everything again to start fresh. 31/1/23

Javascript code ready at 20/2/23, i have'nt worked everyday since last update see commit for more info in that.
